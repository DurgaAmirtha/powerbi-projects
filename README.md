This repository showcases screenshot previews of Power BI dashboards created as part of my learning and portfolio development. The visuals cover insights on the tech job market and financial indicators such as stock performance, GDP growth, and trading volumes. These dashboards were built using cleaned and organized data in Microsoft Excel and designed to communicate trends clearly using Power BI.
